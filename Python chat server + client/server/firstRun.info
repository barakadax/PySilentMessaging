Minimum hardware requirement is CPU that supporting multithreading/multiprocessing.
Recommended 8GB of RAM.
(service was test on winXP, win10 & on Ubuntu 18.4+)
Minimum python version requirement 3.3 & above.

WARNING!: without preforming each of those steps the service won't run.
Please do those tasks carefully.

You will need to install few python packages.
but first you need to update your pip:
*(sometimes using "pip" won't work so instead use "pip3", also with "python" to "python3")*

* "python -m pip install --upgrade pip"

The packages to install:

* "pip install cryptography"
* "pip install pycryptodome"
* "pip install XlsxWriter"
* "pip install SQLAlchemy"
* "pip install psycopg2"
* "pip install crypto"

(if encounter any issues running with those libraries try reinstalling those packages)

Next step is to download postgresql.
While installing keep postgresql ONLY ON LOCALHOST (security measurements)
Keep username as: "postgres"
Keep port as: "5432"
Password you should use: "1234"
(if changed any of those you need to edit "cliDBHandler.py" & "DBHandler.py")

When done installing check from database called "postgres".
If none existent, create one with that exact name.

WARNING!: any typo made will keep the server none functional, recommended copy & paste from what in quotation marks.

Now all you need is to create table, just copy & paste this:

"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS silentUsers (Username text NOT NULL, Password text NOT NULL, PermissionLevel SMALLINT NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (Username));"

Run server from "main.py"
